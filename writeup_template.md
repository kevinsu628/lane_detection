# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

## Writeup Template

### Reflection

### 1. Describe my pipeline. 

As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. 
First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I applied gaussian blur with kernel size 5. Next, I used Canny Edge Detection method to detect the lanes in the image. Then, I defined three vertices: left bottom, right bottom and apex to find the interested area. 
Finally, in order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I Hough transformed image space to hough space, which helps us find lines that have close slope (left lane or right lane). By modifying draw_line() this way, I can plot the averaged lane line consistently. 

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings
Here is one potential shortcoming that my pipeline has: I have to define three vertices globally in order to make the challenge problem work. Meanwhile, the challenge video generated by my pipeline still shows that it can sometimes be unstable when one section of the road does not have any lane lines. 


### 3. Possible improvements 

A possible improvement would be to create a memory system, so that it remembers the lane lines from the previous images. We can just use these values to draw lines when there are no lines detected (or invalid slope)
